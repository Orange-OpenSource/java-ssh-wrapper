##Java ssh wrapper

This library is a wrapper around the [JSch library](http://www.jcraft.com/jsch)

As [JSch library](http://www.jcraft.com/jsch) is quite painful to use directly, we have developed here a wrapping API above JSch to ease the integration and usage of ssh connexions in a java environment.

Today the following features are supported:
- check if we can connect to a remote SSH host
- execute a command on a remote SSH host
- copy a file to a remote SSH host
